# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for restructuring the TikTok Video Processing Tool into a clean, maintainable, and scalable Python application following SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure, so that I can easily navigate, maintain, and extend the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL follow a clear directory structure with separation of concerns
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each module SHALL have a single responsibility
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL support easy extension without modifying existing core logic
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN each file SHALL be under 200 lines and focused on one concern

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection and configuration management, so that the system is testable and configurable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from a centralized source
2. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL support dependency injection for easy mocking
3. WHEN changing configuration THEN the system SHALL not require code changes
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between business logic and UI components, so that I can test business logic independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL be independent of UI frameworks
2. WHEN testing core functionality THEN the system SHALL not require GUI components
3. WHEN switching UI frameworks THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to business logic
4. WHEN adding new UI components THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the application, so that I can debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages with context
2. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with appropriate levels
3. WHEN exceptions happen THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide clear audit trails of operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the video processing logic to be modular and extensible, so that I can add new effects and processors easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new video effects THEN the system SHALL support plugin-like architecture
2. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL use consistent interfaces across processors
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL follow open/closed principle
4. WHEN integrating new codecs THEN the system SHALL require minimal core changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can refactor with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
2. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for all business logic
3. WHEN adding features THEN the system SHALL include corresponding tests
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL support both unit and integration tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain all existing functionality, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the restructured application THEN all current features SHALL work identically
2. WHEN processing videos THEN the output quality SHALL remain the same
3. WHEN using GUI components THEN the user experience SHALL be preserved or improved
4. WHEN migrating THEN existing configuration files SHALL be compatible or automatically migrated
